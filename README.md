TweetDeck Classic
=========================

I loved how TweetDeck looked like before Twitter made the UI less attractive (sorry Twitter guys, but you ruined it!). This is the official extension with dark design changed like it used to be.

Tweetdeck Classic is a Google Chrome extension for Twitter (used to be also for Facebook, Foursquare and Google Buzz, but Twitter guys ruined it, again) with UI developed further from the original Tweetdeck.

This extension won't update automatically! It also forces the theme look like it is, so not much customizations available through admin panels. All credit, honor and glory to Twitter Inc! I do not own this software.

Installation
--------------

- Download this git repo by clicking ZIP button in the top of this page
- Unzip the ZIP file, locate the crx file, go to menu > Settings > Extensions (or type chrome://chrome/extensions/ to address bar), drag and drop the file to Chrome window.
- Have fun!
