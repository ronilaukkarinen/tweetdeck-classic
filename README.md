TweetDeck Classic
=========================

I used TweetDeck back in the days from year 2009. When Twitter acquired TweetDeck in 2011 they practically started from scratch. Not only they removed Facebook, Google Buzz and Foursquare support, but they changed the so-awesome layout as well.

I loved how TweetDeck looked like before Twitter made the UI less attractive (sorry Twitter guys, but you ruined it!). This is the official extension with dark design changed like it used to be.

Tweetdeck Classic is a Google Chrome extension for Twitter (used to be also for Facebook, Foursquare and Google Buzz, but Twitter guys ruined it, again) with UI developed further from the original Tweetdeck.

This extension won't update automatically! It also forces the theme look like it is, so not much customizations available through admin panels. All credit, honor and glory to Twitter Inc! I do not own this software or the old theme for that matter. I have made some customizations as my own, but most of the code are made by someone else. I just want it to look like how it used to be, brilliant by design and pleasant to read.
