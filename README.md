TweetDeck Classic
=========================

I loved how TweetDeck looked like before Twitter made the UI less attractive (sorry guys). This is the official extension with dark design changed like it used to be.

Tweetdeck Classic is a Google Chrome extension for Twitter, Facebook and Foursquare, developed further from the original Tweetdeck.

**Note:** This extension won't update automatically! It also forces the theme look like it is, so not much customizations available through admin panels. All credit, honor and glory to Twitter Inc! I do not own this software.

Installation
